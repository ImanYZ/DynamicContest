    <div style="margin-top:40px;">
        <h2>Contest Phase Instructions</h2>
    <p style="margin-top:40px;">Based on your performance in the training phase, you will be placed in a <strong>group of
        4 players with similar skill levels</strong>. Before you enter a contest, you will go to the
        <strong>waiting page</strong> until everyone in your group is in the waiting page, ready to start the next
        contest.</p>
    <p>The contest phase consists of <strong>{{ contest_number }} contests</strong>. In each contest, you will compete
        with
      {% if player_number == 1 %}
        a
      {% endif %}
        different player{{ player_number|pluralize }} in your group. Each contest consists of {{ game_number }}
        sequential knapsack games. Each game is finished if you can fit the target value (or higher) into the knapsack.
      {% if game_number > 2 %}
        You cannot play each game in a contest unless you finish the previous games in the contest.
        The player who finishes Game {{ game_number }} of the contest first wins a prize of ${{ contest_earning }}.</p>
      {% else %}
        {% if game_number == 2 %}
          You cannot play Game 2 unless you finish Game 1.
          The player who finishes Game {{ game_number }} first wins a prize of ${{ contest_earning }}.</p>
        {% endif %}
      {% endif %}
      <div id="infeasibilityDIV" class="alert alert-warning">
        <h3>Uncertainty:</h3>
        <p>Recall that a <strong>feasible</strong> game is one where the target value can always be reached. While all
            training games are feasible, Game 1 in each contest can either be feasible or not. An
            <strong>infeasible</strong> game is one where the target value cannot be reached, no matter how hard you
            try. More precisely, in an infeasible game, there does not exist a subset of items whose values add up to
            the target value.</p>
        <p><strong>
      {% if game_number > 2 %}
          Other than Game 1, the rest of the games in each contest are
      {% else %}
          {% if game_number == 2 %}
              Game 2 is
          {% endif %}
      {% endif %}
          always feasible.</strong> This means that if you have finished Game 1, you can go on to try and finish Game 2
      {% if game_number > 2 %}
          all the way to Game {{ game_number }}
      {% endif %}
        . Naturally, the contest cannot be completed (and no one can win a prize) if Game 1 is infeasible. You will not
        be told whether Game 1 is feasible or not. Instead, before you start the contest, you will be told that the
        chance Game 1 is feasible is 100% (definitely feasible), 80%, or 60%.</p>
        <p>Before each contest, you will see one of the following sentences displayed on the screen:</p>
        <p>[For the next contest, the chance that the first game is feasible is
            <span id="infeasiblilityPercentSpan1">100</span>%.]</p>
        <p>[For the next contest, the chance that the first game is feasible is
            <span id="infeasiblilityPercentSpan1">80</span>%.]</p>
        <p>[For the next contest, the chance that the first game is feasible is
            <span id="infeasiblilityPercentSpan1">60</span>%.]</p>
        <p><strong>The Quit Option:</strong> At any point in the contest, unless your opponent wins the contest, you
            will have an option to quit by pressing the <strong>"Quit"</strong> button. If you press the button, you
            will be presented with a feasible knapsack game that you can try to solve (with no competition). If you
            finish it, you will get paid ${{ training_contest_earning }}, similar to the training phase.</p>
        <p>Note that if the other player wins, the contest will be over and you will not have the chance to quit and
            play the feasible game.</p>

        <p>At any time during a contest, you will be immediately notified if your opponent finishes Game 1 or quits.
